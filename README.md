## Description
This application is a mock API for a social network web application using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as a database, and Mongoose as an ODM! <br />

## Installation
#### Step 1: Installing Dependencies
Prior to cloning this repository, We must first install any necessary dependencies utilized for this application. This can be done using the following command in your terminal/git bash:
```
npm install
```
Once we have installed all necessary dependencies, the application is ready to use! 
## Seeding
If you would like to test the application, I have provided a seed file which seeds the database with data! To populate the database with dummy data, run the following in your terminal/git bash:
```
npm run seed
```
Once the command is used, the database will now contain dummy data for you to use!
